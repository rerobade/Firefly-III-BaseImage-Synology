Firefly III and the associated tools use the same basic image. This image is built on the php/8.0-apache image with some minor changes and additions. This repository contains the Docker files for the image that Firefly III uses as a base.

## Changes

Basically, I use the 8.0 Apache image with some minor changes.

- Switch to port 8080
- Add extensions for Firefly III
- Install localizations
- Add custom start & run scripts
